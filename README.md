# PAAN
Java Group Project for Java Course at KMITL

# What is PAAN?
A memo desktop application design to be easy to use for students both in School and University.

# Motivation
We always forget thigns especially in school and university where there are many things to be<br>
memoreize. Many memo apps are very good and every detail can be edit, however, it is too detailed<br>
This is wher PAAN where most of the app build around drag & drop and drop down. We trade the detail <br>
by giving simplistic in return.
